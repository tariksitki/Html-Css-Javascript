    SASS: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets

    SASS was written by Hamilton Catlin in 2006 to develop CSS3 with a structure similar to the Ruby language.

SASS is a CSS plugin. SASS is one of the popular, stable and professional level CSS preprocessors.

Why use SASS?

Writing code in CSS is fun, but as stylesheets grow, the situation becomes increasingly complex.

That's where preprocessors can help. SASS offers features that make CSS organized, such as variables, nested structures, mixed build, inheritance, and other nifty goodies that are not in CSS.

Thanks to SASS, we can write fast and orderly with less code, thus it enables to convert CSS from static to dynamic structure.

However, when we link the styling pages to the HTML page, we must link to the CSS file instead of the SASS file.

Because HTML can only be styled externally by CSS files, not styled by SASS or any other kind of files -->


<!-- Difference Between SASS & SCSS Syntax

As the popularity of SASS has increased over time, its usage has become widespread. 

Then, SCSS was created, carrying the SASS properties and the syntax format of CSS, and it was more liked by the developers. Because the syntax of SCSS has with curly braces { } and semicolons (;) was a habit of front-end developers coming from CSS. 

That is why nowadays, SCSS is more common than SASS.  

Let's see some differences:

- When using SASS, semicolons (;) and curly braces { } are not used as in CSS, 

- In SCSS, expressions are separated by semicolons(;). It is a very easy and nice syntax to get used to because of its similarity to CSS,

- When you type curly brackets in CSS and SCSS, it means that is indented one level lower,

- Unlike CSS, when an invalid SASS-SCSS syntax is encountered, the location and reason for the error are presented,

- SCSS syntax uses the .scss file extension, SASS syntax uses the .sass file extension.

For its wide range of usage and popularity, In the software world, "SASS" generally used to describe the SCSS.
