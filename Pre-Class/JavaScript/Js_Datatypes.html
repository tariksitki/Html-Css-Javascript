        Data Types
➤ JavaScript variables can hold numerous data types, such as numbers, strings, booleans, and more.

➤ It is required to declare a variable for creating.

➤ In JavaScript, we can declare a variable with the var keyword.

var myNumber;
➤ The latest ECMAScript standard defines nine types:

➤ Six Data Types that are primitives, checked by typeof operator:

● undefined : typeof instance === "undefined"

● Boolean : typeof instance === "boolean"

● Number : typeof instance === "number"

● String : typeof instance === "string"

● BigInt : typeof instance === "bigint"

● Symbol : typeof instance === "symbol"

➤ null : typeof instance === "object". 
Special primitive type having additional usage for its value: 
if object is not inherited, then null is shown;

➤ Object : typeof instance === "object". 
Special non-data but structural type for any constructed 
object instance also used as data structures: 
new Object, new Array, new Map, new Set, new WeakMap, 
new WeakSet, new Date and almost everything made with new keyword;

➤ Function non data structure, though it also answers for typeof operator: 
typeof instance === "function". 
This answer is done as a special shorthand for Functions, 
though every Function constructor is derived from Object constructor.

➤ To find the type of a JavaScript variable, 
we can use the JavaScript typeof operator.

Example

console.log ("1. " + typeof 0);
console.log ("2. " + typeof (3,14));
console.log ("3. " + typeof "hello");
console.log ("4. " + typeof (7+8));
console.log ("5. " + typeof "Oliver");
console.log ("6. " + typeof "");
console.log ("7. " + typeof true);
console.log ("8. " + typeof (3>=2));
var a;    // Value is undefined.
console.log ("9. " + typeof a);
Output:

number
number
string
number
string
string
boolean
boolean
undefined
    -->

    <script>
      console.log("1. " + typeof "tarik");
      console.log("2. " + typeof 1234);
      console.log("3. " + typeof true);
      console.log("4. " + typeof 3.14);
      console.log("5. " + typeof (3 < 2));
      console.log("6. " + typeof "");
    </script>







            <!-- Numbers -->


            <!-- ➤ Unlike many other programming languages, JavaScript does not define different types of numbers, like integers, short, long, floating-point etc. JavaScript has only one type of number.

            ➤ Numbers can be written with decimals.
            
            var x = 7;
            var y = 33.33;


            Precision
➤ Integers (numbers without a period or exponent notation) are accurate up to 15 digits.

var x = 999999999999999;     
var y = 9999999999999999;
console.log(x);   // output = 999999999999999
console.log(y);   // output = 10000000000000000
➤ The maximum number of decimals is 17, but floating point arithmetic is not always 100% accurate:

var x = 0.2 + 0.1;
console.log(x);   // output =  0.30000000000000004
➤ To solve the problem above, it helps to multiply and divide:

var x = 0.2 + 0.1;
console.log(x);   // output =  0.30000000000000004
var y = (0.2*10 + 0.1*10) / 10;
console.log(y);   // output =  0.3 -->



<!-- var a = 111e3;

bu degiskenin degeri 111000 dir  -->





<!-- BigInt

➤ The BigInt type is a numeric primitive in JavaScript 
that can represent integers with arbitrary precision. 
With BigInts, you can safely store and operate on large integers 
even beyond the safe integer limit for Numbers.

➤ A BigInt is created by appending n to the end of an integer or by calling the constructor.

➤ You can obtain the safest value that can be incremented 
with Numbers by using the constant Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER. 
With the introduction of BigInts, you can operate with numbers beyond the Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER.

> const x = 2n ** 53n;
// 9007199254740992n
> const y = x + 1n; 
// 9007199254740993n
➤ You can use the operators +, *, -, **, and % with BigInts—just like with Numbers. 
A BigInt is not strictly equal to a Number, but it is loosely so.

➤ A BigInt behaves like a Number in cases 
where it is converted to Boolean: if, ||, &&, Boolean, !.

➤ BigInts cannot be operated on interchangeably 
with Numbers. Instead, a TypeError will be thrown. -->








<!-- Symbol


➤ Symbol is a primitive value.

➤ A value having the data type Symbol can be referred to as a "Symbol value". 
In a JavaScript runtime environment, a symbol value is created 
by invoking the function Symbol, which dynamically produces 
an anonymous, unique value. A symbol may be used as an object property.

➤ Symbol can have an optional description, but for debugging purposes only.

➤ A Symbol value represents a unique identifier. For example:

// Here are two symbols with the same description:
let Sym1 = Symbol("Sym")
let Sym2 = Symbol("Sym")
console.log(Sym1 === Sym2) // returns "false"
➤ Symbol type is a new feature in ECMAScript 2015. There is no ECMAScript 5 equivalent for Symbol.

➤ In some programming languages, the symbol data type is referred to as an "atom." -->








<!-- 
Strings
➤ Scripts are defined as the sequence of characters.
➤ In JavaScript, strings are used for storing and manipulating text.
➤ A string can be any content that shows up inside quotes. 
We can use single or double-quotes.

var myName = "John";
var myAge = '36';
➤ We can use quotes inside a string unless 
they don't match the quotes encompassing the string.

var text1 = "I'm John";
var text2 = 'She said, "Go ahead"';
➤ If we need to use quotes inside the string, we can use backslash ( \ ) escape character.

var text = "He said, \"I am a new programmer.\"";
                 // output : He said, "I am a new programmer."
Breaking Long Code Lines
➤ For best readability, programmers often like 
to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.
➤ If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, 
the best place to break it is after an operator:

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =  // Break a code line after 
"Hello Dolly!";                              // an operator or comma -->








<!-- Null
➤ The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.

➤ It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:

let age = null;

➤ In JavaScript, null is not a “reference to a non-existing object” 
or a “null pointer” like in some other languages.

➤ It’s just a special value that represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.

➤ The code above states that age is unknown. -->






<!-- 
Undefined
➤ The special value undefined also stands apart. 
It makes a type of its own, just like null.

➤ The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.

➤ If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined:

let age;
console.log(age); // output: "undefined" -->







<!-- Booleans
➤ A JavaScript Boolean can have one of two values, either true or false.

➤ Boolean data type is useful when we need to have one of two values, 
such as true/false, yes/no, etc.

The Boolean() Function
➤ You can use the Boolean() function to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true:

Boolean (3 > 2);     //return true
Boolean (2 < 3);     //return true
Boolean (2 > 3);     //return false 
Boolean (2 == 3);    //return false 
➤ The Boolean value of everything with a "value" is true.

Boolean("Hello World");
Boolean(5);
Boolean(-5);
Boolean("false");
Boolean(3.14 + 8);   //All of these values return true
➤ The Boolean value of everything without a "value" is false.

➤ The Boolean value of 0, null, empty string, undefined, is false.

Boolean("");
Boolean(0);
Boolean(-0);
Boolean(null);
var x;
Boolean(x);   //All of these values return false -->







<!-- Objects

➤ JavaScript'teki nesneler , diğer birçok programlama dilinde olduğu gibi, 
gerçek hayattaki nesnelerle karşılaştırılabilir. 
JavaScript'teki nesne kavramı, gerçek hayattaki somut nesnelerle anlaşılabilir.

➤ JavaScript'te bir nesne , özellikleri ve türü olan bağımsız bir varlıktır. 
Örneğin bir bardakla karşılaştırın. Bir fincan, özellikleri olan bir nesnedir. 
Bir bardağın rengi, tasarımı, ağırlığı, yapıldığı malzeme vb. vardır. 
Aynı şekilde, JavaScript nesneleri de özelliklerini tanımlayan özelliklere sahip olabilir.


Object properties  (nesne özellikleri)


A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. 
A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object.

var myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = 'Ford';
myCar.model = 'Mustang';
myCar.year = 1969;
➤ The above example could also be written using an object initializer, 
which is a comma-delimited list of zero or more pairs of property names 
and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}):

var myCar = {
    make: 'Ford',
    model: 'Mustang',
    year: 1969
};
➤ Properties of JavaScript objects can also be accessed or set using a bracket notation

myCar['make'] = 'Ford';
myCar.model = "Mustang"; -->




<script>


    var mycar = new Object();

    mycar.make = "Ford";
    mycar.model = ("mustang");
    mycar.year = ("1968");

    mycar["price"] = 50000;
    mycar["firma"] = "Ford";

    console.log(mycar);

</script>




Bu kullanimda ise dikkat edilecek hususlar:
var isminden sonra = 
sonra {}
color gibi herbir özellikten sonra ; degil ,
bu kullanimda new Object yok 

<script>

    var myhouse = { 
   
    color : "Red",
    price : 100000,
    adresse : "Newyork"
    
}

    myhouse["owner"] = "ben"; /* Özellik ekleme*/
    myhouse["year"] = 2022;

    console.log(myhouse);
</script>



<!-- string icerisinde yine ayni tip stringden kullaniyorsak ve bunlarin 
görünmesini istiyorsak  backslash kullaniriz \ -->



<!-- var product = 2.0 *3.0;
Which value should we use for that product will equal 7.0 with changing 3.0 ?
Select one:

var product = 2.0 *3.5;  (dogru sik bu)

var product = 2.0 *3.0+1.0 ; -->
